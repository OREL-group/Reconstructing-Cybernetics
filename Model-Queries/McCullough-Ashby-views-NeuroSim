Based on my research, I can now provide a comprehensive comparison of McCulloch and
Ashby's views on simulating the brain and behavioral regulation.    

__Fundamental Approaches__    
McCulloch and Pitts proposed that neural events could be treated through propositional logic
Peterasaro, creating a mathematical model where neurons function as logical elements asserting
propositions about their inputs Utsa. Their 1943 "Logical Calculus" demonstrated that networks
of these simplified neurons could perform any logical computation, treating the brain as a self-
regulating system using electrical signals and feedback loops to control behavior and thought AI
VIPs. In contrast, Ashby's work assumed the nervous system behaves adaptively and is essentially
mechanistic Amazon, focusing on homeostasis and stability rather than logical computation. His
homeostat demonstrated ultrastability through double-feedback loops with random parameter-
switching (ResearchGate).    

__Behavioral Regulation: The Central Divide__     
The key difference lies in how they characterize behavioral regulation:     

McCulloch's view was computationalist and active. He saw behavior emerging from logical
operations performed by neural networks, with feedback loops allowing systems to adjust
behavior based on environmental inputs AI VIPs. The brain was conceived as processing
information through determinate logical pathways—behavior arises from internal computational
processes. Ashby's view was fundamentally heteronomous (externally driven). His thesis entails that life is
fundamentally "heteronomous"—homeostatic adaptation to the environment governs all aspects
of all forms of life Constructivist Foundations. Critics note that organisms with purely
ultrastability processes are externally driven and in the absence of external perturbations will do
nothing ResearchGate. The homeostat is essentially reactive—it only acts when environmental
changes push essential variables out of acceptable bounds, triggering random parameter searches
until stability is restored.    

Franchi's work suggests this triggers a philosophical reevaluation of the distinction between
heteronomous and autonomous behavior ResearchGate, as Ashby's model challenges traditional
Western philosophical assumptions about agency and autonomy. McCulloch's logical networks,
by contrast, maintain the possibility of autonomous, internally-driven computation, though they
still respond to environmental inputs through sensory channels.    

In essence: McCulloch saw the brain as an active logical computer; Ashby saw it as a passive
homeostatic regulator.

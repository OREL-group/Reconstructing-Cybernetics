__I. How would W.R. Ashby define variety?__   
W.R. Ashby would define variety as the number of distinguishable states or elements in a set. In his cybernetic framework, variety is essentially a measure of complexity or the number of possible states a system can exhibit.
More specifically, Ashby used variety as a quantitative concept - if a system or set has _n_ distinguishable elements, it has a variety of _n_. For example, a traffic light with three states (red, yellow, green) has a variety of 3.
This concept became central to his famous "Law of Requisite Variety," which states that only variety can destroy variety. In practical terms, this means that for a regulator to successfully control a system, the regulator must have at least as much variety (complexity, possible responses) as the system it's trying to regulate. A controller with insufficient variety cannot adequately manage a more complex system.
Ashby treated variety as a fundamental building block for understanding regulation, control, and adaptation in cybernetic systems - whether biological, mechanical, or social.   

__II. How would W.R. Ashby define a closed-loop ultrastable system?__
W.R. Ashby would define a closed-loop ultrastable system as a system with two levels of feedback that can adapt to environmental disturbances by changing its internal organization.    

Key features:    
1) Two feedback loops:    
A primary feedback loop that operates continuously to maintain stability under normal conditions.
A secondary feedback loop that activates when the primary loop fails to maintain essential variables within their critical bounds.    

2) Step functions: When critical variables exceed their acceptable limits, the secondary loop triggers discrete, step-like changes to the system's parameters or structure - essentially reorganizing how the system operates.    

3) Self-organization: The system randomly or systematically tries different configurations until it finds one that keeps essential variables stable. Once a stable configuration is found, it persists until the environment changes enough to destabilize it again.    

4) Homeostat analogy: Ashby's physical "homeostat" device exemplified this - it had primary servomechanisms maintaining equilibrium, but when disturbances were too great, uniselector switches would change the system's parameters until a new stable configuration emerged.
The "ultrastable" designation refers to this meta-level of stability - the system is stable not just through normal feedback, but through its ability to restructure itself when necessary. It's essentially a learning system that adapts through trial-and-error reorganization when faced with disturbances its current configuration cannot handle.    

__III. How would McCullough and Ashby differ in their definition of feedback?__
McCullough and Ashby had fundamentally different conceptions of feedback rooted in their distinct intellectual traditions.
Warren McCullough (the neurophysiologist and cybernetician) viewed feedback through the lens of circular causality in neural networks and goal-directed systems. He emphasized feedback as part of closed-loop systems where outputs return to influence inputs, enabling purposive behavior and homeostasis. His work with Walter Pitts on neural networks focused on how circular patterns of activation could produce stable states and computational functions.
W. Ross Ashby (the psychiatrist and cyberneticist) defined feedback more formally within his framework of regulatory systems and the concept of variety. For Ashby, feedback was a mechanism for variety reduction—a way systems maintain stability by counteracting disturbances. His Law of Requisite Variety implied that feedback mechanisms must be sufficiently complex to match environmental disturbances. Ashby emphasized the regulatory, error-correcting aspect of feedback in maintaining system equilibrium.
The key difference: McCullough tended toward a more neurological and computational perspective where feedback enables complex behaviors and calculations, while Ashby focused on feedback as a regulatory principle for stability and adaptation. McCullough explored what feedback makes possible; Ashby formalized what feedback must do to maintain viability.
Both were central figures in early cybernetics, but Ashby's approach was more abstractly mathematical while McCullough's remained closer to biological implementation.

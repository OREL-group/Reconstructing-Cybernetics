W.R. Ashby would describe closed-loop feedback primarily as a state of effective two-way interaction between components within a system 1. He defines feedback as being present if we can find two variables that are each dependent on the other 2. This interaction forms a circuit where the behaviour of one part is influenced by the other, and this influence eventually returns to the first part 2.    

__Ashby identifies several key characteristics and insights regarding closed-loop feedback:__     
Feedback as a "Closing Link": Drawing on the theory of servomechanisms, he notes that a human operator can be considered part of a control system, acting as the "closing link" that takes account of the difference between actual output and desired output to alter the input 3.     

__The Necessity for Oscillation:__    
Ashby posits that if the variables of an absolute system undergo a recurring cycle of behaviour, feedback must be present 2, 4. He argues that variables cannot be interconnected in a way that produces oscillation without forming a circuit 4.    

__Feedback and Goal-Seeking:__ While many associate feedback with purposive behavior, Ashby argues that goal-seeking behaviour does not necessarily imply feedback; simple systems without feedback can still return to a central state when displaced 5, 6. However, a powerful-acting servo-mechanism utilizing feedback can add a "powerful stabilising effect," making a machine more irresistible to opposition and ensuring it converges to zero error more rapidly 6-8.    

__Critique of "Negative Feedback":__ Ashby considers the concept of "negative feedback" to be too limited and simple to serve as a fundamental concept in general systems 9, 10. He demonstrates that it is algebraically possible for positive feedback to result in stability and for negative feedback to result in instability, depending on the values of the coefficients within the system's matrix 10-12.     

__Feedback as a Selective Change Mechanism:__ In his theory of the ultrastable system, feedback is the mechanism by which the system perceives "pain" or a threat to its essential variables 13, 14. This feedback loop informs the system that its current internal organization is failing to maintain stability, thereby triggering a "reset" or change in step-functions until a new, stable equilibrium is found 15, 16.     

__Feedback through the Environment:__ Ashby emphasizes that a complete dynamic system often includes the environment as a feedback link 17, 18. For instance, a person driving a car is part of a functional loop where their actions affect the environment (the car's position), and the environmental feedback (visual signals from the road) travels back through the driver's brain to correct the initial movement 18, 19.    

Ultimately, Ashby views simple feedback as a subset of more complex reacting circuits 20. He notes that for a part of a system to behave with more stability than it possesses intrinsically, feedback is a necessary condition 1.

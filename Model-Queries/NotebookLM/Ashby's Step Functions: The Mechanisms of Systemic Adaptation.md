In the cybernetic theories of W.R. Ashby, step-functions (often referred to as "breaks") are the fundamental mechanism that allows a system to alter its own internal organization to achieve adaptation. In what Ashby calls a "mixed system," variables are categorized into a hierarchy: null-functions (permanently constant), step-functions (constant for intervals but subject to sudden jumps), part-functions (constant over finite ranges), and full functions (continuously varying) <sup>1,2</sup>.

__The specific roles of step-functions in these systems are as follows:__    

__1. Parameters of Organization__   
Step-functions act as the parameters of organization for the continuously varying variables (full functions) in the system <sup>3,4</sup>. While the full functions represent the immediate behavior of the system, the step-functions determine the "set" or "field"—the rules of interaction—under which those variables operate <sup>5,6</sup>. A change in a step-function value effectively transforms the system into a different "machine" with a new set of behaviors <sup>7,6</sup>.    

__2. The Mechanism for "Breaks" and Adaptation__   
Step-functions are the essential components of ultrastable and multistable systems <sup>8,2</sup>.   
Triggering Change: When the system’s "vital variables" (essential for survival) exceed specific limits—defined as critical surfaces or break-surfaces—a step-function suddenly jumps to a new constant value <sup>9,10</sup>.
Trial and Error: This "break" resets the organization of the system, providing a new field for the variables to explore <sup>11</sup>. This continues in a "trial and error" fashion—described by Ashby as "Heads—I win, tails—we toss again"—until the system strikes an organization where the variables remain within their safe bounds and a stable equilibrium is reached <sup>2,4,12</sup>.    

__3. Simplifying the Search for Stability__    
In a mixed system, step-functions contribute to the efficiency of finding equilibrium. Because step-functions are constant for finite intervals, they are considered to be "already in equilibrium" by definition <sup>13,14</sup>. This reduces the dimensionality of the adjustment problem; the system only needs to adjust its continuous "full functions" relative to the fixed values of the step-functions <sup>13</sup>. Ashby noted that this significantly increases the probability of a system reaching a stable state quickly <sup>14</sup>.    

__4. Enabling Localized Adaptation (Multistability)__    
In more complex multistable systems, step-functions allow the system to adapt in "bits" rather than all at once <sup>15,16</sup>. Because step-functions only affect certain parts of the system, a "break" or change in one area can occur without necessarily disrupting previously established adaptations in other areas <sup>17,18</sup>. This is functionally similar to how genes operate in an organism; a mutation in one gene can alter a specific trait without collapsing the entire biological structure <sup>19,20</sup>.   

__5. Social and Biological Representation__   
Ashby applied the role of step-functions to broader contexts. In a social system, the passing of a new law represents a step-function change that occurs when a social variable exceeds a critical threshold (e.g., a crime wave) <sup>9</sup>. Step-functions are also the neuro-physiological equivalent of genes, provided by the "gene-pattern" to protect the organism’s vital variables through inherited or learned adaptations <sup>8,21</sup>.

16 Dec '47 In writing up my book I came to "change of set" & used Lubbock's work (p.1735). This raised the awkward point that certain variables which don't vary can be treated indifferently as
(58/184) 2306

& then to enquire into the special features which occur when some of them are null-variables, or non-varying variables. In the equations it simply means that we can have x1=fi(x,[Figure]) with [Figure] as parameter, or we can take [Figure] into the system and write [Equations] The factual content in the same so long as we leave the system alone for the arbitrary value of [Figure] in the first is merely [Figure]^0 in the second.

But does this really give enough generality? Shouldn't some of the S's act between M and M? Are we going to get funny properties that I have not expected? So the step-functions control the system effectively? The behaviour of an M, M1 say is defined by dM1/dt=f1(M1,M,...M; S1, S2...) How it reacts to other M's as determined by this equation and from this equation- form there is no doubt that each can alter the functional form. So there's in fact any real limitation in S-> M1-> M2 for the effect of M1 on M2 as compared with, say M1-> S-> M2 (ignoring that S allows only constant values). I don't see it clearly but the form of the equation above suggests strongly that there is no necessary limitation. So long as some effect does get from variable to variable we can put no bounds to its effectiveness. Summary: Multistable system point

Summary. A break may be treated as a mere incident in the development (in time) of one machine. Also one machine may be considered as split into two parts with a break between if one of the variables is a step-function of the time (see next paragraph). A break is a change of organization. Changes of organization have two causes: 1) Due to conditions outside the machine, which are arbitrary parameter changes, + are my doing. 2) due to conditions inside the machine- a break if we ignore the cause.

I have be reinvestigating the conditions etc of breaks (p. 893). In particular the question of whether a break-surface specifies everything (p.898). Giving the results briefly we have, firstly, a break is a change of organisation. Next, because the break events are actually natural, however much of a nuisance, they must therefore be deductible from the immediately preceding [sic] state of the system and that therefore it is always possible to set up a new substitution which shall comprehend the previous substitutions, [equations] applying before the break and [figure] applying after the break.

20 Dec '47 2304 On p.2181 I noted that homoeostasis means constancy, & constancy means independence. But independence what of what? The answer is now obvious. Man, & every animal, is dominated by the gene- pattern. Even if his intelligence is not due to synapses prescribed in detail by genes it is more the less produced by step-functions put in en bloc by the genes. And why do they want the animal to be intelligent? Obviously to protect the gene-pattern.    
(67/184) 2315    
And why homoeostasis? If we say that hemoeo--stasis is necessary for, say, the brain to work properly, we are explaining in a circle. We must look for something outside the homoeostatic set as explanation and cause. To the gene pattern, homoeostasis successfully achieved is a guarantee that the genes can get safely to their next pattern. Genes which form homoeostatic mechanisms around themselves survive, since they are insulated from the vagaries of the world. Those who neglect this precaution perish. We are, therefore, walking incubators for the protection of our testicles. Is this true or is it not? Summary: Homoeostasis is ultimately produced by the gene-pattern, and it protects the gene-pattern from the dangers of the world because the constancy means independence.

In the previous section, and p. 965, we noted the profound importance of variables which stay at one value for a time and then suddenly change to a new, constant value: [figure]    
Owing to its shape I propose to call such a function a "step-function." We new define it. We may easily define it straight away for several variables.

I have decided to drop the necessity for strictly two values, allowing the value on the I-surface to be anything.     
A step-function [figure] is a function of n variables [figure] , such that [figure] has only two numerical values* [arrow pointing above] possible/ except perhaps on the I-surface,/ and is/a/ single-valued function of its arguments. SO far this simply gives an arbitrary scattering of two number [figure] and [figure] throughout the x-space without any continuity. But this is of little use. We want the [figure]'s to be collected together, also the [figure]'s. This means there must be a boundary where they meet. So we add the further restriction that this surface must exist and be specifiable as a surface [figure] value [figure], and on the other side of it [figure]. If there are complications we may restrict ourselves to some suitably marked out region of the x-space if we don't want all of it.

Summary. "Step-function" is defined. An analytic formula given for one. If a function in a substitution is a step-function of the variables, the corresponding variable in the solved equations is a step-function of the time. The effect in a field of step-function is discussed. The /essential/ conditions for a break are a cloud of dots, each of which has a number associated with it,/saying "change one of the step-functions to this new value."/ and not a surface as suggested on p. 898.

Heads- I win; Tails- we toss again.    
Clearly such a system has only two endings: 4either it finds a stable system + stops changing, or it exhausts itself and finishes in some (unofficial) ruin.    
This seems to me to settle the subject.

After the previous classification I can make an attack, of sorts, on a problem attempted a year or so ago but abandoned. I refer to getting an estimate of the relation between number of part-functions activated + the chance of getting an adaptation without upsetting another set. A very crude start can be made by simply assuming that any line of behaviour activates P variables at random. Total variables are n. Change that a set will be stable is (p. 1869), sometimes, [figure] where m is the number concerned. Suppose Q variables are marked. On the average [figure] resets will be required to find stability giving [figure] variables activated, all drawn at random. The chance that one variable should be non-Q is [equation], so that chance that all should be non-Q is [equation]. This is usually near unity since interaction is slight. Suppose it is 0.9 and that n is [figure].

We have n equations homogenous in the n quantities da(1), da(2), ... da(p-1), 1, da(p+1), ... da(n). We form the eliminant, divide the pth column by da(p), write -1 for all a(++) and get:
| a-1 a(12) ... a(1p) ... a(1n) | = 0 |a(23) -1 ... a(2p) ... a(2n) | | ... ... ... ... ... ... | |a(p1) a(p2) ... -da^1(p)/da(p) ... a(pn) | | ... ... ... ... ... ... | |a(n1) a(n2) ... a(np) ... -1 |

We may now show as on p. 1867, 1976 top, that partition will occur, i.e. that any given (finite) line of behaviour will leave some of the variables not activated.     
We can then give a modern proof of the main theorem: A line of behaviour L is not altered by any other line of behaviour M causing bounds provided the variables associated with the bounds are not activated by the line of behaviour L, (in a multistable system, of course!) (See p. 2006 for one bound)    
Proof: Write the set of variables activated by L and M as [figure] and [figure] respectively, and write the bounds associated with [figure] as [figure]

I chain that neuronic adaptation cannot be inborn & adopted by natural selection since there are (p.2285) only 48,000 genes to control 10,000,000,000 neurones. Yet the human race is clever, as a species, & this cleverness is inborn & is due to the inborn gene-pattern. So the genes are responsible basically for a man's cleverness in adaptation. Then what do I think about genes as responsible for man's adaptation? This....

is probably closely related to Golla's objection that any "clever" machine will have to be designed & made clever by someone- it will not make itself- so he concludes that all machines are just slave machines. There is clearly serious confusion here, in both our minds. Obviously, in the first case, it has something to do with the idea that you cannot fix 10^10 independent para-meters indepently if you have control of only 48,000 means to control. The latter cannot carry the load. What the human race does, on my theory, is to use part of its 48,000 for reflex mechanisms, part for bodily functions so that the blood is properly oxygenated & carried to the brain, etc, & then the rest are gambolled on providing some step-functions & some part-functions, hoping that they will be able to get order out of the (almost) chaos. This is related to my machine. Obviously, if I have two units to get stable, needing....

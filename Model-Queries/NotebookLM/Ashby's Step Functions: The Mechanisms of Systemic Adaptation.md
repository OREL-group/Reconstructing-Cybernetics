In the cybernetic theories of W.R. Ashby, step-functions (often referred to as "breaks") are the fundamental mechanism that allows a system to alter its own internal organization to achieve adaptation. In what Ashby calls a "mixed system," variables are categorized into a hierarchy: null-functions (permanently constant), step-functions (constant for intervals but subject to sudden jumps), part-functions (constant over finite ranges), and full functions (continuously varying) <sup>1,2</sup>.

__The specific roles of step-functions in these systems are as follows:__    

__1. Parameters of Organization__   
Step-functions act as the parameters of organization for the continuously varying variables (full functions) in the system <sup>3,4</sup>. While the full functions represent the immediate behavior of the system, the step-functions determine the "set" or "field"—the rules of interaction—under which those variables operate <sup>5,6</sup>. A change in a step-function value effectively transforms the system into a different "machine" with a new set of behaviors <sup>7,6</sup>.    

__2. The Mechanism for "Breaks" and Adaptation__   
Step-functions are the essential components of ultrastable and multistable systems <sup>8,2</sup>.   
Triggering Change: When the system’s "vital variables" (essential for survival) exceed specific limits—defined as critical surfaces or break-surfaces—a step-function suddenly jumps to a new constant value <sup>9,10</sup>.
Trial and Error: This "break" resets the organization of the system, providing a new field for the variables to explore <sup>11</sup>. This continues in a "trial and error" fashion—described by Ashby as "Heads—I win, tails—we toss again"—until the system strikes an organization where the variables remain within their safe bounds and a stable equilibrium is reached <sup>2,4,12</sup>.    

__3. Simplifying the Search for Stability__    
In a mixed system, step-functions contribute to the efficiency of finding equilibrium. Because step-functions are constant for finite intervals, they are considered to be "already in equilibrium" by definition <sup>13,14</sup>. This reduces the dimensionality of the adjustment problem; the system only needs to adjust its continuous "full functions" relative to the fixed values of the step-functions <sup>13</sup>. Ashby noted that this significantly increases the probability of a system reaching a stable state quickly <sup>14</sup>.    

__4. Enabling Localized Adaptation (Multistability)__    
In more complex multistable systems, step-functions allow the system to adapt in "bits" rather than all at once <sup>15,16</sup>. Because step-functions only affect certain parts of the system, a "break" or change in one area can occur without necessarily disrupting previously established adaptations in other areas <sup>17,18</sup>. This is functionally similar to how genes operate in an organism; a mutation in one gene can alter a specific trait without collapsing the entire biological structure <sup>19,20</sup>.   

__5. Social and Biological Representation__   
Ashby applied the role of step-functions to broader contexts. In a social system, the passing of a new law represents a step-function change that occurs when a social variable exceeds a critical threshold (e.g., a crime wave) <sup>9</sup>. Step-functions are also the neuro-physiological equivalent of genes, provided by the "gene-pattern" to protect the organism’s vital variables through inherited or learned adaptations <sup>8,21</sup>.

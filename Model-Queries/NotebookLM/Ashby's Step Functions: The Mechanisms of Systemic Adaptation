In the cybernetic theories of W.R. Ashby, step-functions (often referred to as "breaks") are the fundamental mechanism that allows a system to alter its own internal organization to achieve adaptation. In what Ashby calls a "mixed system," variables are categorized into a hierarchy: null-functions (permanently constant), step-functions (constant for intervals but subject to sudden jumps), part-functions (constant over finite ranges), and full functions (continuously varying) 1, 2.

__The specific roles of step-functions in these systems are as follows:__    

__1. Parameters of Organization__   
Step-functions act as the parameters of organization for the continuously varying variables (full functions) in the system 3, 4. While the full functions represent the immediate behavior of the system, the step-functions determine the "set" or "field"—the rules of interaction—under which those variables operate 5, 6. A change in a step-function value effectively transforms the system into a different "machine" with a new set of behaviors 7, 6.    

__2. The Mechanism for "Breaks" and Adaptation__   
Step-functions are the essential components of ultrastable and multistable systems 8, 2.   
Triggering Change: When the system’s "vital variables" (essential for survival) exceed specific limits—defined as critical surfaces or break-surfaces—a step-function suddenly jumps to a new constant value 9, 10.
Trial and Error: This "break" resets the organization of the system, providing a new field for the variables to explore 11. This continues in a "trial and error" fashion—described by Ashby as "Heads—I win, tails—we toss again"—until the system strikes an organization where the variables remain within their safe bounds and a stable equilibrium is reached 2, 4, 12.    

__3. Simplifying the Search for Stability__    
In a mixed system, step-functions contribute to the efficiency of finding equilibrium. Because step-functions are constant for finite intervals, they are considered to be "already in equilibrium" by definition 13, 14. This reduces the dimensionality of the adjustment problem; the system only needs to adjust its continuous "full functions" relative to the fixed values of the step-functions 13. Ashby noted that this significantly increases the probability of a system reaching a stable state quickly 14.    

__4. Enabling Localized Adaptation (Multistability)__    
In more complex multistable systems, step-functions allow the system to adapt in "bits" rather than all at once 15, 16. Because step-functions only affect certain parts of the system, a "break" or change in one area can occur without necessarily disrupting previously established adaptations in other areas 17, 18. This is functionally similar to how genes operate in an organism; a mutation in one gene can alter a specific trait without collapsing the entire biological structure 19, 20.   

__5. Social and Biological Representation__   
Ashby applied the role of step-functions to broader contexts. In a social system, the passing of a new law represents a step-function change that occurs when a social variable exceeds a critical threshold (e.g., a crime wave) 9. Step-functions are also the neuro-physiological equivalent of genes, provided by the "gene-pattern" to protect the organism’s vital variables through inherited or learned adaptations 8, 21.

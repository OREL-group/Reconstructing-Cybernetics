## How you W.R. Ashby describe the concept of variety?

W.R. Ashby describes the concept of variety primarily as the number of distinct configurations or states a system can assume <sup>1,2,3</sup>. He treats this quantity as fundamentally equivalent to information, using logarithmic units such as "bits" (binary digits) to express it precisely <sup>4,5</sup>.     

__Key aspects of Ashby’s description of variety include:__     
Quantitative Measurement: Ashby defines the amount of variety or information in a system as the logarithm to the base 2 of the number of possible states available to that system <sup>3,6</sup>. For a system where multiple states have different probabilities of occurring, he uses the Shannon entropy formula ($I = -\sum p \log p$) to calculate the average information or variety present <sup>5,7</sup>.    

__Exponential Growth:__ He demonstrates that the variety of a system's possible organizations increases with extreme rapidity as the number of its components (n) grows <sup>8</sup>. For example, in a system of n distinguishable variables where each can be either active or inactive and can be connected by various arrow patterns, the total number of possible types of organization grows at a rate faster than $2^{n^2}$ <sup>9,10,11</sup>.    

__Variety in Biological Systems:__ Ashby applies these measures to biology, calculating that the human genetic inheritance of approximately 50,000 genes provides 50,000 "bits" of variety if each gene can independently assume one of two states <sup>12</sup>. However, he notes that the "richness" of a response is not always proportional to the input; a single "bit" of variety can trigger a massive, pre-established complex organization within a machine <sup>13</sup>.   

__Variety of Human Action:__ To find a practical measure for the variety of human behaviour, Ashby suggests counting the number of verbs in a dictionary <sup>14</sup>. He estimates that a typical person has a repertoire of roughly 10,000 characteristic actions, representing the system's "output variety" <sup>15</sup>.   

__Conservation and Destruction of Variety:__ A central tenet of Ashby's theory is that an absolute system (a deterministic machine) cannot generate its own variety <sup>16,17</sup>. The output of information from such a system is exactly equal to the input it receives from its parameters <sup>16</sup>. Over time, variety in an absolute system typically decreases as lines of behavior converge toward a neutral point or cycle; these convergent junctions act as "sinks" where information is destroyed <sup>18,19</sup>.   

__Requirement for Adaptation:__ Ashby suggests that for an environment to be "adaptable," it must not be a total chaos of infinite variety <sup>20</sup>. Instead, the world must contain a large proportion of part-functions, which allow the environment to be functionally divided into smaller, manageable sub-systems that an organism can adapt to independently <sup>21,22</sup>.   

Ultimately, Ashby views variety as the "raw material" of regulation; for a system to remain stable in a changing environment, it must possess sufficient internal variety to counter the variety of disturbances it faces <sup>23,24</sup>.

possible states, then the whole has /not more than/ [figure] possible states. The occurrence of one will carry /not more than/ 7 bits of information. Further, as the whole is absolute, the occurrence of a state determines the line that follows, so the further information is redundant. The importance of my new point of view is that I can measure the information in a part, and that the partial measures add to give /something not exceeding/ that in the whole. The sub-measures are: (1) The occurrence of a certain state in B, regardless of what happens in A, gives /at most/ 2 bits of information. (2) Given that a certain state in B is being watched, the occurrence of a certain line from that state gives /at most/ 5 bits of information. Summary: In an absolute system formed by the junction of independent parts, if a particular /part/ can take one of p initial states and can show [figure] lines of behaviour from each initial state, then the quantity of information [equation] cannot be exceeded whatever part has been chosen.

I discussed the question of p. 2787 (top) with Gold + found he disagreed with the whole point of view. He argued that complexity doesn't necessarily need any number of genes for its production: the most complicated organisation can be produced as a result of a single 'bit' of information once the producing machinery has been set up. He also thought that the number of genes depended more on advantages in evolution by mutation. Then Pringle said that a 'gene' is only a portion of chromosome never yet known to split.....

After the previous classification I can make an attack, of sorts, on a problem attempted a year or so ago but abandoned. I refer to getting an estimate of the relation between number of part-functions activated + the chance of getting an adaptation without upsetting another set. A very crude start can be made by simply assuming that any line of behaviour activates P variables at random. Total variables are n. Change that a set will be stable is (p. 1869), sometimes, [figure] where m is the number concerned. Suppose Q variables are marked. On the average [figure] resets will be required to find stability giving [figure] variables activated, all drawn at random. The chance that one variable should be non-Q is [equation], so that chance that all should be non-Q is [equation]. This is usually near unity since interaction is slight. Suppose it is 0.9 and that n is [figure].

We may now show as on p. 1867, 1976 top, that partition will occur, i.e. that any given (finite) line of behaviour will leave some of the variables not activated. We can then give a modern proof of the main theorem: A line of behaviour L is not altered by any other line of behaviour M causing bounds provided the variables associated with the bounds are not activated by the line of behaviour L, (in a multistable system, of course!) (See p. 2006 for one bound)      
Proof: Write the set of variables activated by L and M as [figure] and [figure] respectively, and write the bounds associated with [figure] as [figure]

I claim that neuronic adaptation cannot be inborn & adopted by natural selection since there are (p.2285) only 48,000 genes to control 10,000,000,000 neurones. Yet the human race is clever, as a species, & this cleverness is inborn & is due to the inborn gene-pattern. So the genes are responsible basically for a man's cleverness in adaptation. Then what do I think about genes as responsible for man's adaptation? This is probably closely related to Golla's objection that any "clever" machine will have to be designed & made clever by someone- it will not make itself- so he concludes that all machines are just slave machines. There is clearly serious confusion here, in both our minds. Obviously, in the first case, it has something to do with the idea that you cannot fix 10^10 independent para-meters indepently if you have control of only 48,000 means to control. The latter cannot carry the load. What the human race does, on my theory, is to use part of its 48,000 for reflex mechanisms, part for bodily functions so that the blood is properly oxygenated & carried to the brain, etc, & then the rest are gambolled on providing some step-functions & some part-functions, hoping that they will be able to get order out of the (almost) chaos. This is related to my machine. Obviously, if I have two units to get stable, needing.....

p. 7. He notes that to get orderly behaviour from the brain, the latter must follow exact laws, i.e. ones which are largely immune from the random atomic movements due to heat. This implies that even the neuron details (concerned in functioning) must be large relative to atomic sizes. An obvious example is that an organism cannot develop precision of movement unless it is large enough to be practically immune to Brownian movement.

Have recently made a psychoanalytic discovery about myself. The interesting point is that this one point has a vast number of ramifications. Apparently, while an adult can make all sorts of little decisions, the child or infant can only make the simplest decisions. Thus the adult thinks "shall I go to the pictures or theatre?" The child, howveer, has to make the deicison "shall I take an active or passive attitude to the world." Notice in the "pictures" example how much is already decided: the 'going-out,' the 'aim to be entertained,' etc.

What does the Jacobian become when we turn to an infinitesimal transformation? Suppose we change form x(i) to a point u(l), a fraction K along the line from x(i) to x^1(i) (figure)    
Then our new (formula). If K is infinitesimal, then so is the transformation. Forming the Jacobian, e.g. 3 variables, we get (3x3 matrix). This gives (formula) where the terms in the bracket are of order K^2 or higher. This means that as K -> O, J -> 1 with no chance of getting anywhere near 0, which is where the interesting things happen. The point is that J is intended to deal with transformations which at one step change to something very different. But as almost all natural things do transform by inperceptible degrees, I presume that the Jacobian of a machine is of little importance.

Note on "breaks." Firstly, an essential part is the idea of irreversibility. Consider for instance the change in the motor car when the back axle becomes independant of the engine. This may be done by a break in the transmission or by putting the gear lever into neutral. We do not and cannot (but see p. 1038) use the word 'break' for the latter. We see that irreversibility is essential. Next the idea of suddenness is essential. Long drawn out changes where a parameter slowly alters, e.g. due to the perishing of elastic, is not ordinarily considered a break.......

W.R. Ashby describes the concept of variety primarily as the number of distinct configurations or states a system can assume 1, 2, 3. He treats this quantity as fundamentally equivalent to information, using logarithmic units such as "bits" (binary digits) to express it precisely 4, 5.     

__Key aspects of Ashby’s description of variety include:__     
Quantitative Measurement: Ashby defines the amount of variety or information in a system as the logarithm to the base 2 of the number of possible states available to that system 3, 6. For a system where multiple states have different probabilities of occurring, he uses the Shannon entropy formula ($I = -\sum p \log p$) to calculate the average information or variety present 5, 7.    

__Exponential Growth:__ He demonstrates that the variety of a system's possible organizations increases with extreme rapidity as the number of its components (n) grows 8. For example, in a system of n distinguishable variables where each can be either active or inactive and can be connected by various arrow patterns, the total number of possible types of organization grows at a rate faster than $2^{n^2}$ 9, 10, 11.    

__Variety in Biological Systems:__ Ashby applies these measures to biology, calculating that the human genetic inheritance of approximately 50,000 genes provides 50,000 "bits" of variety if each gene can independently assume one of two states 12. However, he notes that the "richness" of a response is not always proportional to the input; a single "bit" of variety can trigger a massive, pre-established complex organization within a machine 13.   

__Variety of Human Action:__ To find a practical measure for the variety of human behaviour, Ashby suggests counting the number of verbs in a dictionary 14. He estimates that a typical person has a repertoire of roughly 10,000 characteristic actions, representing the system's "output variety" 15.   

__Conservation and Destruction of Variety:__ A central tenet of Ashby's theory is that an absolute system (a deterministic machine) cannot generate its own variety 16, 17. The output of information from such a system is exactly equal to the input it receives from its parameters 16. Over time, variety in an absolute system typically decreases as lines of behavior converge toward a neutral point or cycle; these convergent junctions act as "sinks" where information is destroyed 18, 19.   

__Requirement for Adaptation:__ Ashby suggests that for an environment to be "adaptable," it must not be a total chaos of infinite variety 20. Instead, the world must contain a large proportion of part-functions, which allow the environment to be functionally divided into smaller, manageable sub-systems that an organism can adapt to independently 21, 22.   

Ultimately, Ashby views variety as the "raw material" of regulation; for a system to remain stable in a changing environment, it must possess sufficient internal variety to counter the variety of disturbances it faces 23, 24.
